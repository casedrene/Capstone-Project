Paige Karklis I lover velourlips because they are gorgeous colours that stay in place all day and night,  they have a perfect Finnish and just look amazing on! Plus cruelty free! :) Because once you've gone matte there's no going back! Brought 3 shades of velourlips today and wow what an amazing product it stayed on my lips for hours and loved the range of colours. Even better its aussie made and cruetly free and smelt so yummy <U+2661><U+2661><U+2661> I love it cause it doesn't leave lipstick on glass :) Velourlips are amazing. It's pretty simply put. Bright fun colours, super long-lasting wear, matte so I don't have to worry about touching up or smearing lipstick everywhere while eating & drinking, massive colour range, not drying like other liquid lipsticks, VERY opaque. I can't stabd liquid lipsticks that you need to apply 2649288 coats for. The smell omg -the smell is what originally drew me to velourlips. I don't know what it is but holy hell I love it. Literally every time I'm in a store where I can smell smell, I do! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> and not to mention they're cruelty free which is a massive plus. They keep my pout perfect, pigmented, and pretty as a picture!!! Inexpensive, cruelty free,  Aussie owned,  beautiful colours.  I've used so many liquid to matte lipsticks some costing over $25.00 less than half the price for a far superior performance! love them because not only are they top quality, they're beautiful shades as well as cruelty free, created by a trust worthy australian brand, what more could I ask for? Velourlips are my fave because the colours are so intense and they last forever! I don't have to reapply over and over again to keep the shade and they make me feel as close to a makeup artist as possible because someone who struggles at makeup like me can pull these off easy! :) I love velourlips because
1  very pigmented when you apply to your lips 
2 it really gives you the matte finish like they promise.
{ i try the expensive one but they dont do what they promise also its so expensive.}
3 it doesn't smell like plastic or even taste like one.
{ some expensive one got the same problem they smell and so stickz }
4 they stay long as in long to your lips without thinking it might come off when you eat or drink
5 they're really friendly on your pocket
6 the color is so bright and doesnt fade or smudge
7 its product of our very own australia
8 the case or bottle of velour lips is air tight. If you notice some lip gloss or lipstick in a tube when you put them back inside the white protector on the inside always pup out because of the air inside. Velour lips tube dont do it.
9 its not messy and easy to store in your bag
10 if theres a chance you left velour tube at home you have confidence thats the one your lips will last longer
11 theres no harsh chemical that you need to worry about. 
12 all in all i love It and i bought 6 of them. Cant wait to throw away all my old lipstick. The colour range and staying power is amazing.  The packaging is pretty cute too <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> They make my lips very pretty and having these colours would complete my collection <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008B> Live vibrant colour range Love love love them!!! You never have to worry about them getting anywhere and stay on allll day/night!!! I L<U+2661>VE Velourips because it makes my lips plup, perfect and ready to kiss which is a must! Such a devine range xx I love velour lips cause the colours are the bomb and last ages! No need to reapply <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> Botox in a bottle....vibrant colours that go the distance! Velourlips are my favourite lip products because they last so long, are super pigmented and suit my lip type so much. My lips are too dry for lipstick so I have to use matte lip creams and these are perfect! Once the product is on, it won't budge and I love that. Thank you for making these Australis! I recommend Velourlips to everybody who asks, ""what lippy is that you're wearing?""
The colours are one of a kind and being budge proof all day - what more can a girl ask from her lip colour? <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C> When is this drawn? I can't stand the suspense!

My signiture eye look consists of earthy brown tones and oranges. I like doing a smokey eye and using a black eyeliner to emphasize my inner corner. Orange and brown tones make my blue eyes pop and the black eyeliner makes the look so much better. I'm pretty boring with brown tones usually, and every so often add a really bright pop of colour into the inner corner! I love using the screw up coloured Australis eyeliner! My signature eye look begins with a primer over my lids. After that, I apply a shade that is slightly lighter than my skin tone under the eyebrow on the brow bone and blend that down, adding a slightly darker shade over my entire lid. Then I apply a light gold shimmery shadow below the crease, and then use a medium brown in the crease and blend that in. If I'm going for something a little bit flashier, I'll sometimes apply a pink shimmer toward the inner corner of the eye, and the same brown used in the crease in the outer corner. Occasionally I'll run a little bit of the gold shadow under my waterline on the lower of my eye. Follow that up with a subtle brown eyeliner, and then finish off with a dark brown mascara. For my brows I usually just use an angled brush to apply some brown eyeshadow, and set it with a brow setting gel. I'm trying to go out of my comfort zone and get into some stronger and more interesting colours, as this look is usually fairly subtle. Cheers for the opportunity to participate in the competition :) I don't wear eye make up currently but would start with this great set, will read the comments for great tips.

Black and smokey 
all the way,
I get my fierce on 
every day!! I love smokey eyes and a touch of shimmer. Liquid eyeliner if I really wanna stand out! Comp ends in March? I love to K.I.S.S my eye make up- Keep It Simple Silly with smoky brown  highlights to bring out my blue eyes. It's a simple look but it's beautiful especially when matches with effortlessly toussled hair! I follow my 3 E's.

Step one: Enhance. I have brown eyes so I like to enhance them with purple mascara and a smudge of purple eye shadow along the top and bottom lash line to bring out the brown. 

Step two: Elevate. Two wings - one so sharp and fierce it could kill a man and the other so wobbly you'd think a child with a crayon did it in comparison to Van Gogh's art on the left eye. But in the end, they're wings and they help me soar through my day :)  

Step three: Errrhm eyebrows. I'll fill 'em in based on my mood and what I want the world to see me as that day.

And I'm set! I like a simple, classic look so just some liquid black eyeliner along my upper and lower lash line, with a gentle upward sweep at the corner, and some quality volumizing and lengthening black mascara to finish it off. I start off with my eyeliner, wing it and then go on to the mascara to achieve nice and long eyelashes, and if I am bothered, I would also fill in my brows Love wearing my false lashes, and enhancing them with only the most FIERCE mascara! Taupes and golds are my go-to shades, as they brighten my eyes and make them look larger! Paired with inky winged black liquid liner, voluminous mascara coated lashes(..maybe even falsies ;)) and perfectly on point brows, this look can take me from day to night in a flash! I like to do a smokey eye using metallic kinda colours and i finish the look with a simple winged liner and do half of my bottom lid with black or white eyeliner depending on my mood A Shimmer of shadow.. A lick of Mascara and a winged eye, which takes precision but then makes my eyes POP! :) Just a question Australis Cosmetics the end dates says 29/03/2015? I presume this isnt correct. When is the end date? Thanks <U+2661> The Smokey Eye

T&C’s apply.","2015-07-24 18:15:01",51,8,"Using a long lasting  pencil along my upper eye lid I apply a tiny bit of eye cream to help it glide not pull. use with a white eyeliner under your to eyeshadow to make it really stand out Don't be afraid to Change the colour occasionally for a totally different look ..blues greens & teals can look amazing enhancing  your natural eye colour If you're finding it hard to apply your eyeline in this colder weather because it's dragging, warm it up by rolling it in your hands briefly to warm up the oils. Skip free lining! I use tape to do my wings .. helps me get an even application on. The best Idea I have found to apply! Always use colours that match your eyes .. Experiment with colours too I use two different eyeliners to make my eyes pop . One light and one dark! Tape, my god tape works wonders. There's always a roll ready to use stashed in my makeup kit. It helps to Crete any design with a sleek, mess free finish. My winged eyeliner method: hold your breath, dont rush and have cotton tips at the ready for mistakes!  :P Fast and the furious is our house hold tip for who can get to the bathroom and mirror first. ..I try to apply appropriately. Use gel eyeliner, its much easier to apply and rest elbow on a bench when applying for support-no poking yourself in the eye!  :) Dont drink before applying lol as you need a steady hand. Either have a steady hand or i get my daughter to do it as she can see what she is doing Make sure you can see clearly :) Always have a steady arm and practice makes perfect! Cotton buds are my best friend take a deep breath before applying it helps me to relax and never be afraid of experimenting A magnifying mirror makes it a hell of a lot easier Make your eye makeup last longer by setting your eyeliner with a matching eye shadow :) My magnifying light mirror, pull the skin tight when drawing on my eye lid, taking my time & cotton tips to fix any mistakes. Also I put white liner on the inside, help makes my eyes pop & look bigger:) A light brush of Australis Cosmetics Bronzing Powder, a smidge of Australis Cosmetics Gold Gaga Metallix Eyeshadow, a fine smudged line of Australis Cosmetics Cray for Colour 'Drawn to Diamonds' Eye Pencil & finish it all off with a coat of Australis Cosmetics Fierce Eyes Mascara ;) Do the eyeliner so your eyes stand out not the other way around were the first thing you notice is the eyeliner... Trying to have a steady hand, and using Australis ready SET go translucent powder to set my liquid liner so it doesn't transfer to my lid You have to be cool calm and collected to be sure you don't have a shaky hand! Always draw with the pencil/liner on a very close angle to your face - not pointing at your eye! Gently sweep from the outer eyelid towards the lash line,  this also reduces pull on the eyelids and makes for a smooth line :) I only use eyeliner on my top water line and then false lashes, I don't do the whole eyeliner on my eyelids haha xD Practice makes perfect and I have been practicing the winged liner since the 80s before it was so cool and now im a master :) 
Check me out with my winged liner and le tan bikini from the 80s :) To stop your eyeliner from smudging, use black eyeshadow to set it. Take time, small little strokes is best and then join together, make a mess if needed, and tidy up with cotton tips! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> To stop eyeliner smudging. The best fix is to pat a little translucent powder or concealer on top of your liner. It'll help dry things up right away, keep liner from sliding off oily skin, and help prevent it from shifting when you blink. To get the perfect cat eye . Use two pieces of Scotch tape to create a triangle at the outer corner of your eye, then fill in with liner, remove the tape, and you get a perfect flick. Curl your lashes and apply eyeliner all in one by drawing the pencil on the curler. Pencil on bottom, liquid on top. Try to make the top line as thin as possible so if you make a mistake you have room to fix it. Pull the skin tight at the outside corner of your eye so then skin on your eyelid is tight and you can get a nice straight line. Don't blink until it's dry. Fix up any little mistakes with a damp cotton tip! White eyeliner on lower rim, and along eyelash line , eyelash Curler. Sprayed with hairdpray all while holding mouth in a O expression Apply a lighter shadow in the corners of your eyes and only line the outer part of your eyes to open them up and make them brighter start from the wing tip then draw the liner towards your inner eye. always gives me a clean line and even wing :) I use tape to make a perfect straight winged eye liner and it works every time. I also keep it steady and work on it slowly instead of drawing the whole line and then making mistakes. :)) I don't know anybody else but I always have trouble putting on eyeliner. Use dots or dashes if you're still not confident of applying a straight line in one go. Apply small dots or dashes along the line you want and then join them with a larger line. Practice, practice and more practice helps too! Lovely eyes Lineweight is so important I start from the inner end of my lash line very thin then trace to the center of the lid from there i draw almost a straight line out to the outer counter then joint the end of the line and the outer section of my lash line, fill in the gap and finally apply a little of the outer third of the bottom lash line and smudge it along the rest Using tape from the lower lash line to the end of the brow for the perfect application every time I wear eyeliner every day.. The tip is practice makes perfect.. Each day looks that bit better!!  :) definitely practicing regularly and looking through different youtube tutorials to see other people's technique. my favourite one is using a pencil liner to draw a basic shape first, so mistakes can be corrected and so that there is a basic outline of the line, so much easier for beginners! I just fluke it! Small little lines joined up,  usually ends up well ;) Remove your bra and put on trackie daks. Trick that eyeliner into thinking you are just playing around with makeup, because the moment you mention plans 'mistakes' are gonna happen! Lots of practice - and cotton tips to clean up mistakes! I start with the flick to point to the end eyebrows so if they are uneven and you need  to re do its not messing up the whole eye. Then draw a line towards inner eye and thicken to what ever mood I'm in on that day. 
If i wanna bring my eyes out more id use a white  shadow on the bottom  line from the inner to middle  out and use a gold on the outer side. Black liner half way along ur eyes (top eyelid) white eyeliner makes eyes look younger / fresher... Use white on inside of bottom eyelids, black on the outside - accent wirh a small flick for extra drama- top with plenty of mascara!!! When applying liner, try not to pull the skin on the side of your face and if things get a little messy, clean up your line with a makeup remover-soaked cotton swab. Use a felt tip eyeliner for the winged look, it doesn't smudge as easily and will last longer. Use tape to get a perfect even wing :) Buy every single type of eyeliner so you are set for every occasion - love a purple wing every now and again! To get the perfect wing cut a triangle into an old bank card etc... and then place it in the position your want you wing and then just fill it in! Perfect every time <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D>","7469","Fri","18","12"

Dear Australis, would you consider helping our campaign?                  Many thousands are speaking up for the captive performing dolphins at Sea World Gold Coast Australia with the help of international and local celebrities but we also need your help, and voice.

AUSSIE DOLPHINS HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM THE OCEAN AND SOME BRED IN CAPTIVITY BUT ALL ARE FORCED TO PERFORM DAILY AT SEA WORLD ON THE GOLD COAST, QUEENSLAND.

""The whole world is up in arms about Sea World and other aquaprisons. It's time that Australians opened their eyes and became educated to the cruelty of trapping and breeding dolphins as money-making slaves for greedybusinesspeople"".

'SEAWORLD SHUT DOWN on Facebook. The First & Only Campaign Against Sea World in Australia' .

Trevor Long, Marine Science Director at Sea World Gold Coast says: ""Dolphins aren't some amazing creature, in the wild they just rape and rape and rape"". (Quoted from Gold Coast Bulletin interview January 2015).

Please help us to speak up for the captive performing dolphins at Sea World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.

We love them rescuing cetaceans but we loathe them keeping dolphins as captives in their aquaprison.

The dolphins need to be rehabilitated and freed or taken to a safe sanctuary/bay/cove paid for by Sea World to live out their lives without human interference.

India, Croatia, Hungary New York, South Carolina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Nicaragua, Slovenia, Switzerland, Brazil, Poland, Luxembourg, Norway and the U.K have already banned cetaceans in captivity and so far there are over 18,000 signatures on the petition and a Facebook page with over 10,820 followers. Also on Twitter @seaworldisevil with over 6,990 followers

The dolphins are caught from the ocean and brought to tanks/lagoons and are also bred in captivity where they are forced to perform for paying customers and given dead fish but only if they do tricks. All to make money for greedy Sea World business people.

Besides being a loving loyal friend, she posesses so many warm great qualities. I know she always puts herself last so would   really love to see her get spoilt, Have my fingers crossed!! Xx cos she can never afford to buy makeup, she doesn't get much of anything, would like to see her get something nice for christmas this year. Every year I see the disappointment so I am determined that Kathy Ferguson-Clark not miss out on what she REALLY wants to find under the Christmas tree My beautiful daughter Natasha Jackson is so very deserving to win this prize she is a Mum who gives her all and a daughter I am proud of she is a sweetie. Fingers crossed <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0096><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009B> Tegan Wilson is looking for a job and she deserves this under the tree as a little something special to get her work ready. While she's looking for jobs she calls in and does things around the house to help me out, does chores in town for me and let's the dogs out when I'm going to be late home. I think I will miss that when she gets a job.... Definitely Mary Carpenter because she was doing such a good friendly deed, weeding someones garden and  accidentally ripped her leg open on a stump, its a massive laceration and very painful. This would be great under her tree to brighten her up <3 Jay Hurley she loves Make up as much as I do <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008B><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009D><U+2728><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+00AB><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00BB><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+009B><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+008B><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+00A0><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+00A0><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B5><U+00B6><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0085><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BB><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B9><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BE><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BE><U+0085><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BD> yes please My teenage daughter would love this, she is just learning about the world of make up and it would be great to give her some really nice quality stuff to help her on her way!! i think my best friend Nikki Wilkinson should win because she is always likes and shares your comps and is the most dedicated comper i know, she also is the best friend i have ever had and is their for me any time i need her, as she is for all her friends and family. she deserves to win because she is the most caring person i know. <3 xx Katrina Warburton because she is as obsessed with makeup as I am we love makeup and she an strong person even though sometimes she doesn't think so xxxxxxx and because she loves your brand xxxx <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><U+263A><U+FE0F><U+263A><U+FE0F><U+263A><U+FE0F> Danyelle Mcclennan - she is my bestie for over 20 years! she is naturally gorgeous but I know she would LOVE this pack and feel fabulous <3 Trust me, she totally deserves this!

Reloaded Aroshi Pandu Holly Carran such a good idea!! Alex O'Toole Isabella Louise Mauzzachelli-Thompson Katie Gorman Attaching a short eye liner pencil (that's too small to hold) to the end of a new pencil with a rubber band. Now it has a long 'handle' and you can keep using it Victoria Adeline Lori Jane Melville Pop two drops of Saline solution (contact solution) in the mascara bottle. Shake really well. Be careful not to put too much in because then it gets messy and extremely wet. 
Just like a brand new bottle (almost)! Cream Pot Eye Liner  -  Apply a drop of oil free moisturiser to the pot with a Q-tip or toothpick. Allow it to sit for a few minutes and then gently stir. This moistens the creaminess back to normal and it is then ready for use, Caro Jenkins If  sharpening doesn’t work on your good pencil eye liner,  it’s usually because the product has dried out inside the stick. The best way to fix this is to use a hairdryer. Hold the pencil a few centimetres away from the blowdryer’s nozzle, and move the dryer back and forth along the length of the pencil. This will consistently warm the product and melt it just a little; in about thirty seconds, your pencil liner will be as good as new.

Recently went cruelty free so decided I'll give them another go... Well obviously I can't because the colour selection sucks! Hi Australis I love your cosmetic range and since going cruelty free, then you guys are the best. However I have recently purchased this new foundation and do not like it compared to your old one. I find it really flaky and makes my skin look really old not vibrant and glowing like the way you advertise it. Please re stock you old foundation as well as I prefer this much better.

I was super excited for this product and went into a Coles to have a look. Again, extremely disappointed to find out the middle colour is the shimmer highlighter and not the matte highlighter....  Please PLEASE release the matte highlighter in a separate colour like banana powder so I don't have to keep buying a whole new contour kit just for one colour. This is ridiculous. Agreed! Please bring out the single matte powder! We don't need that much highlighter in our lives!

I love my AC on tour contour cream palette in light. It's got the creams go on perfectly and are useful for more than just contouring. I love the yellow cream as it does wonders for the darkness under my eyes. The eye primer is my fave, not only does it smooth the lid ready but it makes my eye make up last all day ( or night) <U+2605><U+2606><U+2605><U+2606> Thanks Australis ! The metallix cream eyeshadow in bronzonce/gold Gaga. Stays put for hours and doesn't crease or smudge. It's my go-to when I want a glittery look but don't want to deal with glitter glue and glitter. Just a dab on the lids and blend a little. The Ready Set Go finishing powder! It stops my foundation from melting off even in hot weather, and patting some over my lipstick makes it matte and keeps it on all day <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> Banana Powder!

It seriously has the best coverage and lasts all day, even when I play sports!!!! I have way to many favourites, I love all Australis products, I use to wear really expensive makeup but since trying Australis I haven't worn any other brands! But if I had to choose it would be the contour kit! Love it!!! I love the cream contour palette It's hard to pick just one but if I have to it would be my metallix eyeshadow in Plum Diddy. Great colour and amazing pigmentation and softness I love my Australis products, i can't pick a fave! I am currently using the 'Lick the Icing' lipstick which is fab, i get compliments about it all the time.  The 'Mix it' foundation which provides perfect coverage for me & I've got almost every single Australis nail colour, i love them because they are so easy to apply & they look lovely.

I'm also super keen to try the new contour powders! Love your work Australis Cosmetics xx The Australis Velour-lips in any colour is my favorite product

The first contour I found that doesn't make my skin look dirty or orange. And I love a bit of gold shine on special nights out, metallix doesn't move or crease up! My favorite product is the Australis Fresh and Flawless Powder - my shade is Natural and I have gone through 3 tubs in 2 months...

Seriously it's the first thing that a person notices about you and it frames your eyes amazingly!!! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> I love my Australis Setting Spray- because rain, hail, or too much Australian Sunshine, it's always got my back! (Not to mention it smells AMAZING- and is cruelty free! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095>) The banana powder. It is exactly what I need to brighten my dark circles.

I love the contouring kit: helps me to look and feel like a supermodel <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0089> Not only are they the perfect products, they don't test on animals.

I also love the eyebrow pencils and pressed powder foundation. I just love everything australis The Australis fresh and flawless powder! It is my holy grail of all makeup items! Lasts all day and my makeup doesn't budge. The best thing ever <U+2764><U+FE0F> My absolute fave of all time is the pressed powder in deep natural!! I have literally been using it for like 10 years IM NOT KIDDING I still even have a compact from FOR EVER ago :D <3 Metallix eyeshadow in gold gaga, absolutely amazing shade on eyes and I have even been experimenting with it as a glowing highlighter and it's absolutely amazing! Really difficult to choose, particularly as you have high quality, animal-friendly products, which is a HUGE plus!

But I have to stick with the basics and go with the ""Cya Later Pores Primer"". It provides the same texture as other brands that are literally 3x the price, and makes everything sahhhh smooth! Bonus that has worked for me is that even if I don't put tonnes of makeup on top, it evens out my skin tone well enough that I just need a light dusting of powder and I'm good to go.

Even if I don't win this, ladies and gents, you need to get on their primers!!! I love the Australis rapid tan, it's a gift from the gods! It's the only tanning product I use and it makes my skin so radiant! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><U+263A><U+FE0F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BC><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BC> My favourite Australis product is definatly the high life highlighting powder because you can never have too much glow & shimmer on your face in love ! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> Foundation is awesome coverage and long lasting Australis is my fav product: I LOVE the rose water setting spray!

The setting spray!!! I love it!! when I spray it on I feel like I've been frolicking in a field filled with roses eating Turkish delight all day!! It keeps my makeup on all day even during the gym! It's honestly so amazing, and if I'd had a breakout or my skin has reacted to something and it's red and angry I can just spray some on and the rose water helps calm my skin down! 

And then the 4 in 1 concealer, it 100% covers my dark circles or red spots and im super impressed on how well it works for me

And the velvouslips matte lip cream, I love the range of colours they come in and I find that they smell soooo nice!!! And I love how they actually dry matte. There are so many lip creams that claims they dry matte but don't. So I love that these do! Because 1. I love the look of a nice matte lip, and 2. If I'm wearing lipstick my boyfriend won't kiss me unless it's actually 100% matte <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082>

But that one product that i do have is just amazzzzing. Its the ""pressed powder"". 
Keeps my delightfully oily skin on hold for quite some hours.  Its like i said. Amazing!!! I love the Velourlips because they're a great pop of colour during the grey Winter months. And Spring and Summer and Autumn... The 'Oh hai brow!' shaping kit is my life saver. I catch public transport to work and apply my makeup on the train, so I need a product that is: easy to carry, simple to apply but does an amazing job. Not only have I found the product straight forward to use, I can play it up and down depending on the look I go for.

The amount of girls that have complemented my eyebrows is crazy!! Especially while I'm doing them on the train <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> I wanted to stock up yesterday during the 40% off cosmetics promo at Priceline, but you were completely sold out.

It's perfect for setting my under-eye concealer and not making me look like a panda (which is something that a lot of other brands have done, so congrats guys!~) The velour lips Bae-Jing. It is with out a doubt the best colour and lipstick I have ever used and I have extremely sensitive lips. Most products irritate but not this. Very awesome product. I recommend it to everyone. When your favorite brand just gets better and better....

Also make up setting spray  it is very refreshing in summers , love the fragrance  of rose water  in it while spraying over my make up. My favourite is my first ever lipstick, a colour inject (I think?) in Mambo. It's my ""old faithful"" and the colour I based my entire look around. I've still got it, there's about 5mm left and the case is cracked, no writing left on it - but it's still sitting proud in my makeup case. A reminder of my style and my love for cruelty free cosmetics. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D> My favourite product is the Australis fresh and flawless pressed powder , it is the best one I have ever used will never use another powder <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> I only buy australis make up products because they are cruetly free. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+0087>

The texture is lovely and mousse like, super pigmented, holds for 14 hours plus without a single crease or crumble. Shades are phenomenally pretty and reflect the light beautifully as well as show deep colour at the same time.  As a major bonus the shades have not caused harm to a single animal.

They're ceramist lipsticks I've ever used and so comfortable to wear. Ac on tour broke the internet when it first came out who could find a quality contour palette for under $20?! I love how you challenge the industry with affordable products and innovative new ideas and items that work Kalina Pepper Felicity Bishop My favourite product would have to be the powder contour kit. I have multiple kits but they honestly don't work the same. The Australis contour kit blends nicely and really does work on my pale skin tone. I've recommended it to all my friends My favourite Australis product is the Pressed Powder. I can never fault it. It's light on your skin, doesn't clog your pores and always gives me a fresh and flawless look whether I'm in a hurry or not. I have never turned back to any other pressed compact powders since first using this product. It's definitely a must have beauty product that everyone should have or atleast try! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0096> My fave is the fresh and flawless powders cos they're so full coverage and the price is so.good. The lip liners are amazingly soft and have great staying power. Fave lip liner, even over some high end alternatives. I love Australis makeup because it's affordable and completely cruelty free. But my favourite product is definitely their velour-lips range. I love a bold lip without getting all dried out and this is the perfect product for that! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009E> My fave has to be the AC on tour contouring highlighting kit!<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> just perfect for a low key or high key day/night! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008C> Love love love the ac on tour contour kit! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> I love the ""Paparazzi"" range especially the bluish as you never know when your photo will be taken.

I love the 'Oh Hai Brow Kit' it really makes the  eyebrows look really defined and on camera it enhances your eyebrows and looks astonishing. I would love to win because I would like to buy a lot of Australis products because I love them so much they are my favourite brand of makeup. I've just started my YouTube channel and recently purchased my first Australis product. I absolutely love the High Life Highlighting Powder. It gives a great shimmer and is VEGAN FRIENDLY! That was the main reason I opted for Australis being vegetarian and all. I'm gaining more and more experience but I don't own much makeup. This would give me a great opportunity to do first impressions and get the brand a lot more publicity. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+00B0><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+00B0><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095> The velourlips because there's a colour for every occasion, you only have to any once and it's affordable! Oo hard to pick a fave but the AC on tour pallette in light would have to be the current fave i reach for it over my other contour pallettes. It just compliments my skin tone ao flawlessly xx I love my AUSTRALIS PINOT DAH NAIL POLISH. It looks great, and is long lasting. Australis Bronzing Powder is my absolute favourite! I have been using it since my teens. The perfect colour in achieving that radiant glow, quality product I'd be lost without it!! banana powder is my fav, it helps me hide my bags and makes me look somewhat human! I love the Metallix cream eyeshadow. There so easy to use, a wide range of colours and they make your eyes look absolutely gorgeous!! xx I love all your products, that why you got 220k likes of Facebook because we love your products,there are  just amazing.

It is the best brow it I have ever tried. Its the only brow kit and brand that gets my eyebrows so defined to perfection. I love how it also comes with tweezers so i can fix stray hairs and a high lighter for under the brows. 
Its easy application and stays on my brows all day. I'm so thankful for your Oh Hai Brow Kit because without good eyebrows its not a good day. I love your contour kit! it's so highly pigmented and there are lovely matte Browns for contouring :) My favourite Australis product would have to be either the 'Matte out mattifying face base' or the colour inject lipsticks because the face base turns all my foundations matte and the lipstick is very moisturising on my lips and aren't harsh like a lot of other ones + you can't beat the low price! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0098><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> The Banana Powder <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BD><U+008C> It's my new favourite powder because it highlights without caking up <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BB> My FAVE Australis Cosmetics product is a new one - I can't pick between those I already own because I couldn't live without any of them. :) My favourite Australis product is the AC Contour and Highlighting Kit in light. It makes contouring and highlighting a breeze and super easy for beginners. :) Ooh yes please this would be amazing <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0083> Fingers crossed  colour inject lipstick is my favorite <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BE><U+0081>

So refreshing and gets rid of the excess powder! <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F> Blackest black eyeliner pencil<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> I love it because so far it's the only eyeliner Iv found that stays all day and doesn't smudge. And works anywhere you put it- water line, top of eyelid even as a face pencil for kids and kitten faces. 
It lasts for ever too!! And the price is so affordable!! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> Velourlips for sure! No need to reapply during the day, they even last through dinner. Perfection :) Mumbai matte is my favorite! Always so many compliments whenever I wear it! I'm obsessed with the Australis Metallix range, they're so pigmented and beautiful  <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D>
Love the clever names too, Lana del grey, Gold gaga, Plum Diddy are a few of my favourites <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0086><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0086> The new Secret Agent Lip Liner! Not only does it go with everything, BUT it's the best lip liner I've ever used. The setting spray!!! I love it!! when I spray it on I feel like I've been frolicking in a field filled with roses eating Turkish delight all day!! It keeps my makeup on all day even during the gym! It's honestly so amazing, and if I'd had a breakout or my skin has reacted to something and it's red and angry I can just spray some on and the rose water helps calm my skin down! 

And then the 4 in 1 concealer, it 100% covers my dark circles or red spots and im super impressed on how well it works for me

And the velvouslips matte lip cream, I love the range of colours they come in and I find that they smell soooo nice!!! And I love how they actually dry matte. There are so many lip creams that claims they dry matte but don't. So I love that these do! Because 1. I love the look of a nice matte lip, and 2. If I'm wearing lipstick my boyfriend won't kiss me unless it's actually 100% matte <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082>

So...for the sake of my entry lol, I'll go choose one and go with my holy grail finishing powder - the Australis Translucent Finishing Powder. 
It doesn't cause break outs, its affordable and it's cruelty free (like all Australis products), and it keeps my makeup looking decently fresh, even after 8 hours with my new bub! 
A definite holy grail product <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008C> 
Thanks Australis! My favourite product is the contour palette, my skin is a brown complexion so I'm finding that the texture of the palette works really well with my foundation and is easy to blend! I've had trouble finding an affordable yet satisfying palette and I found that the Australis contour palette meets my needs.

I also love the banana powder! I bought it today and I'm so totally digging it especially for the colour of my skin. <U+2764><U+FE0F> Velour lipsticks! Love them! They last such a long time, and the colour payoff is amaze!!!!! absolutely love your contour pallet!! the colours are so amazing and so pigmented !

Has to be the contour kit! I also use it for my brows it's basically a two in one <U+2764><U+FE0F> My favourite product is the australis pout paste. I have it in every colour! They are vibrant, have amazing staying power, come in a variety of colours. I can't tell u a favourite because I haven't got any Australis products at the moment. I have tried your products in the past like all other brands but I currently only use Nude by Nature & Maybeline I trust these because they work for me but if I had the opportunity to win this I reckon I could then pick something out as my fav is. I'm very interested in trying but unfortunately can't afford to go out & buy all the products to do so. So please pick me I would totally write a good review on Facebook & Instagram about my experiences i absolutely love the Let's Go Steady Tinted Gradual Body Moisturiser! It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, while giving it a healthy glow Loose Translucent powder to top my look with a matte finish :) been wearing it everyday for years without fail <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> I definately  go cray cray for my Maliboo velourlips, its long lasting, smooth, great application, wear time and opacity.

It truly is an amazing and extremely affordable product for all ages. You use to have an aqua eyeliner pencil, I used to wear nothing but that particular one! Then one day I couldn't find it anywhere, I used to look in every store that stocked your products just in the off chance it would be there but alas it never was! Every time I wore the eyeliner I was always complimented on how gorgeous it looked & how the colour was amazing. Please, please bring it back!! The contour and highlight kit, so easy to use and i love that its powder with shimmery particles :"") and it looks so good Australis Stay Put Foundation - Nude, does exactly what it says...stays put. Vienna Sirvid The powder contour kit has got to be the best product because out of all the contour kits that exist this is the one that I'll always go to. It's easy to apply, which is useful if you've never contoured before, it's animal cruelty free and it's supporting our economy by buying high quality Australian makeup products that we don't have to spend a fortune on. I use it every day, even when I'm having a lazy day at home. It's by far, the best product. #australisCosmetics  tickled pink lip gloss

The high life highlighting powder, it's great for contouring the face :) Banana powder, great redness concealer! Velourlips is my favorite. I almost own every shade of it. It is just great and one product for every occasion.. The Ac On Tour Contour Kit , because the highlighters and the yellow powder and the contour shades are just perfect  for when u want a defined , highlighted face when ur in a rush to go out I love their eye shadows. I have been using them since my high school days back in the 90's and still do! My favourite product is velourlips Doo-Bai.
I personally can't stand having anything on my lips but I've found velourlips to be comfortable. Doo Bai velourlips is the only lipstick I've been able to find in my hair colour. I love Australis products and velourlips would have to be my favourite of all! The fresh and flawless powder is the best powder I have ever used by far has the best coverage and studying power. And the velour lips are my favourite liquid lipsticks the colours are insane love love love <U+2661><U+2661> the entire range is brilliant and affordable to anyone Velour Lips for sure! I've tried so many high end products like Kylie Lip Kit, Jeffrey Star & Mac and your Velour Lips is still the best! The biggest range of colours, last all day, a smell to die for and the 5 mini's for $15 kit is a steal! My fav products are Australis pressed powder and the contour kit. They pressed powder is amazing for setting foundation and the contour kits is just amazing it goes on so well and blends really nicely. Velourlips! Every other lipstick / gloss always wears off and leaves my lips dry, but these last forever and have amazing colours and don't dry out my lips <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> The stay put foundation!

Mambo is my go to lip colour everyday and I take it everywhere I go and get so many people hooked on it! I love the contour palette it can be used in many different ways. The colours are diverse and suite warm and cool toned skins. The highlighters make the skin look glowing. I also love how light, Medium and dark palettes are available so they can match any skin colour. Every colour is bendable and for $16 I don't know how it is so good. I recommend this product to all my friends and I think it is a must have. Defiantly one of my top beauty products! I LOVE my Bronze Eyed Girl matte eyeshadow palette! All the shades are super usable across the board! I use the lightest shades as blending shades, the yellow one works super well for a setting powder in a pinch! They are so super buttery, little to no fallout, and the colour payoff is amazing!
It's something I'd pay full-price for, and I nearly never buy anything not on sale! I love the Australis Fresh and Flawless powder because no affordable brands make very yellow toned shades and now I'm not going broke trying to set my makeup Lena Lee enter The velour lips is my fav!

It has great coverage, feels nice on the skin and lasts pretty much all day without the need to prime and great on those days you need to leave in a rush :) Rose water setting spray! Keeps my makeup looking gorgeous! Velour lips <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+009A> I have the purple shade, it's dashing <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C> My favourite product is definitely the Velourlips matte lip cream. It is amazing with such vibrant colour and stays for ages. Is great for dancing I can kiss for hours wearing your Velourlips, the staying power is absolutely fantastic! x I love the formula of the clear lip liner- it keeps my lipstick looking fine and now I don't have to buy individual colours. Such a godsend, esp. with those less common lippie colours. I love the velourlips, the colours are beautiful, they last really well without over drying and when I wore Doo-bai to see my favourite drag queen perform she even complimented me on the colour. I love your cream contour kit I have chubby cheeks so yeah lol I love the AC on Tour Contouring Kit Cream  I use it to highlight between my brows to camouflage the frown lines and all the bits of my face that need help it seriously works it is AMAZING  so much so it buys me exra months between botox!! <3 Thanks so much  Australis Cosmetics xx The setting spray!!! I love it!! when I spray it on I feel like I've been frolicking in a field filled with roses eating Turkish delight all day!! It keeps my makeup on all day even during the gym! It's honestly so amazing, and if I'd had a breakout or my skin has reacted to something and it's red and angry I can just spray some on and the rose water helps calm my skin down! 

And then the 4 in 1 concealer, it 100% covers my dark circles or red spots and im super impressed on how well it works for me

And the velvouslips matte lip cream, I love the range of colours they come in and I find that they smell soooo nice!!! And I love how they actually dry matte. There are so many lip creams that claims they dry matte but don't. So I love that these do! Because 1. I love the look of a nice matte lip, and 2. If I'm wearing lipstick my boyfriend won't kiss me unless it's actually 100% matte <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082>

Adds that lovely classic pop of colour to any make-up style, or to add that lovely pop of colour to your outfit. Doo-Bai is my absolute favourite! By adding a dab of Rio-D to centre lips and fading it out into Doo-Bai, it makes an awesome gradient matte lip! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+008B><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+0084> My favorite look is a bold smokey eye with Hon-o-loo-loo. Hon-o-loo-loo is by far my favorite, because with my skintone is so pale lately, the color is bright and inviting to everyone I smile at! I have been complimented many times on this lip color and adore it! I recently wore Doo-bai to the Ipswich Cup Races and it was phenomenal. I wore a bright red dress, with black and cream accessories so Doo-bai was the cherry on top for this outfit! Mixing Lun-dun and Rio-d is the ultimate colour for my pale skin!
